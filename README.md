# High-low.py
This is a Python-based "Higher or Lower" game where users guess which social media account has more followers. The game continues as long as the player makes correct guesses, with the score increasing for each correct answer.

Description
The "Higher or Lower" game challenges the player to compare the follower counts of two random social media accounts and guess which one has more followers. If the player guesses correctly, their score increases, and the game continues with a new comparison. The game ends when the player makes an incorrect guess.
